# NLP-applied-on-Computer-Assisted-Language-Learning
An applied research exploring the application of Natural Language Processing on Computer Assisted Language Learning of Arabic

This is an applied research with strong emphasis on the literature review of NLP and its potential for assisting people in learning languages. 
The aim is specifically towards investigating NLP to build a prototype to assist people in learning Arabic.

After the research phase, I built a small prototype where I experimented with NLP and Arabic, by programming everything from scratch.
I did not rely on any libraries or corpora for this, as one goal I set for myself is to learn how NLP works.
I defined my own Arabic dictionary and added my own features for every word.
Then I used Backusâ€“Naur form (BNF) to express a few grammatical rules in the Arabic language.
Relying on the dictionary I created and the grammatical rules I defined, my protoype is able to detect and recognize a few mistakes that 
people tend to make while learning Arabic. The prototype can then provide useful feedback adapted to each mistake.
